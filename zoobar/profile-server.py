            ## Your job is to set up the environment to run pcode correctly
            ## (for exercise 10) and safely (for exercise 11).

            ## You will need to figure out where and how to supply the code
            ## that needs to run.  You can tell python.wasm to run specific
            ## python code by passing that filename as an argument at the
            ## end of wasi.argv.  Note that the executable profiles expect
            ## to be able to import the library code from api.py in order
            ## to interact with the ProfileAPIServer through the FIFO.

            ## The RPC client in the WebAssembly sandbox (from api.py) expects
            ## to communicate with the ProfileAPIServer through a FIFO located
            ## at /run/fifo.  You will need to arrange for this to work.

            ## You will also need to figure out how to get the output from
            ## the WebAssembly sandbox and return it from this function.
            ## You can get wasmtime to write the output to a file by setting
            ## wasi.stdout_file to the pathname where the output should go.

            ## The profile code expects to be able to read and write persistent
            ## state in the /data directory.  You will need to arrange for this
            ## to work.

            ## For exercise 11, you will need to ensure that the executable
            ## profile code cannot tamper with the Python library code.  One plan
            ## could be to create a separate copy so that it doesn't matter if
            ## it's corrupted.  Another plan could be to set the Unix user ID of
            ## this process to something other than root (e.g., 566) using
            ## os.setuid; since the library files in wasm_python_dir are owned by
            ## root, the wasmtime runtime won't be able to modify them then.

            ## Finally, for exercise 11, you will need to deal with profile code
            ## that doesn't terminate.  The wasmtime runtime allows interrupting
            ## a running module by calling engine.increment_epoch().
